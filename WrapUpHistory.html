        <h2>Origins in India</h2>
        <p>The earliest form of chess originated in India around the 6th century AD. 
        The game was called "chaturanga," which means "four divisions of the military" 
        - infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots, represented by the pawn, knight, 
        bishop, and rook respectively.</p>
        
        <h2>Spread to Persia</h2>
        <p>From India, the game spread to Persia where it was called "shatranj." 
        When Persia was conquered by Muslims in the 7th century, chess spread throughout 
        the Islamic world and later into Europe.</p>
