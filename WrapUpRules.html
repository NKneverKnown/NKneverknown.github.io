        <h1>Basic Chess Rules</h1>
        
        <p>Chess is played on an 8x8 square board with alternating light and dark squares. 
        Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, 
        two knights, and eight pawns.</p>
        
        <h2>How Pieces Move</h2>

        <h3>King</h3>
        <p>The king moves one square in any direction. It's the most important piece - 
        if your king is captured, you lose the game.</p>
        
        <h3>Queen</h3>
        <p>The queen is the most powerful piece. It can move any number of squares in a 
        straight line - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>
        
        <h3>Rook</h3>
        <p>The rook moves any number of squares in a straight line horizontally or vertically.</p>
        
        <h3>Bishop</h3>
        <p>The bishop moves any number of squares diagonally. Each bishop starts on a 
        specific color and must stay on that color.</p>
        
        <h3>Knight</h3>
        <p>The knight moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction, then one square 
        perpendicular. Knights can "jump" over other pieces.</p>
        
        <h3>Pawn</h3>
        <p>Pawns move forward one square, but capture diagonally. On their first move, 
        they can choose to move two squares forward.</p>
